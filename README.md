Multi-Step Form Description:

A multi-step form is a user-friendly interface that breaks a long or complex form into several stages or steps. Each step typically asks for a specific set of information, making the process easier to complete and less overwhelming for the user. This type of form is ideal for gathering detailed data without overwhelming users with a large number of fields on a single page.

Key Features:
Progress Indicator: A visual indicator that shows users which step they are on and how many steps are remaining, so they can track their progress.
Conditional Logic: Some fields or steps may appear or change based on previous responses to ensure the form remains relevant and personalized.
Validation: Each step can validate input before moving forward, which reduces errors and ensures accurate data collection.
Save & Resume: Some multi-step forms allow users to save their progress and return later, making it easier for people to fill out lengthy forms.
Responsive Design: Multi-step forms are designed to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring that everything works well across different screen sizes.
Example Use Cases:

Account Registration: Breaking up the process of gathering personal details, account preferences, and payment information.
Surveys: Breaking a long survey into thematic sections for better user engagement.
Checkout Process: Streamlines the e-commerce checkout by taking shipping, payment, and review information in separate steps.
A multi-step form makes complex tasks manageable, and thus helps improve the conversion rate by reducing the abandonment of forms.
